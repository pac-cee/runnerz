# Library Management System - Spring Boot Project

This project is a simple Library Management System built with Spring Boot. It's designed to help you learn Spring Boot concepts through practical implementation.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Spring Boot Basics
- **@SpringBootApplication**: Main application class that bootstraps the application
- **Auto-configuration**: Spring Boot automatically configures components based on dependencies

### 2. Data Persistence
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Used for object-relational mapping
- **Entities**: Represent database tables (e.g., Book)
- **Repositories**: Provide CRUD operations (e.g., BookRepository)

### 3. REST API
- **@RestController**: Creates REST endpoints
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Request Mapping**: Maps HTTP requests to controller methods

### 4. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
- **Mocking**: Simulate dependencies using Mockito
